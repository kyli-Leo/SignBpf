# SignBpf base on libbpf-bootstrap: a bpf program that checks signature and limit resources of unsigned executable
## Install Dependencies

You will need `clang` (at least v11 or later), `libelf` and `zlib` to build
the examples, package names may vary across distros.

On Ubuntu/Debian, you need:
```shell
$ apt install clang libelf1 libelf-dev zlib1g-dev
```

On CentOS/Fedora, you need:
```shell
$ dnf install clang elfutils-libelf elfutils-libelf-devel zlib-devel
```

## How to compile and run

Makefile build:

```
$ cd source
$ make
$ sudo ./lsm (with additional argument)
